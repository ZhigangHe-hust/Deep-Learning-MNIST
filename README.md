# Dataset preparation

## Introduction to the MNIST Dataset

### Overview

**MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)** is a classic handwritten digit image dataset, widely used in introductory tutorials and benchmarks in the field of machine learning and deep learning.

### Dataset Contents

**Number of images**: 70,000 grayscale images <br>
**Training dataset**: 60,000 images <br>
**Test dataset**: 10,000 images <br>
**Image format**: 28x28 grayscale images <br>
**Labels**: Each image has a number label from 0 to 9 <br>

### Data Example

Here is some data from the MNIST dataset:

## Download the dataset

MNIST is already integrated into Pytorch, so you can download it directly through the script

```
python data.py
```

# Model Training

Before training, you need to create a folder in the current directory to store the checkpoint file

```
‚îú‚îÄ data.py
‚îú‚îÄ dataloader.py
‚îú‚îÄ ¬∑¬∑¬∑
‚îú‚îÄ output
‚îÇ ‚îú‚îÄ checkpoint
```
Input in the terminal
```
python train.py
```

If model training terminates unexpectedly, or you want to add more training rounds, you can run the following command:

```
python retrain.py --checkpoint_path output\checkpoint\checkpoint_epoch_N.pth --epochs M
# M is the total number of training rounds for the final model (default is 10)
# checkpoint_epoch_N is your last checkpoint file
```

# Model Testing

```
python test.py
```
